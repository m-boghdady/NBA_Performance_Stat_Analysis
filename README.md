# NBA Players Performance Analysis 2023-2024

Welcome to the repository for the NBA Players Performance Analysis for the 2023-2024 season, hosted by students of The American University in Cairo under the course MACT3223 Statistical Inference. This project aims to dissect the performance dynamics across different player positions and provide insights into their impacts on team performance metrics.

## Project Overview

This repository contains all materials related to the comprehensive statistical analysis of NBA player performances from the 2023-2024 regular season. The objective is to explore the contributions of various player positions to their teams' overall success, with a focus on creating a robust "Attacking Performance" metric and other key performance indicators.
